# Improperties
Code for my Upcycled Science post *Properties and improperties of stratified and simple randomisation* at https://upcycledscience.com/properties-and-improperties-of-stratified-and-simple-randomisation/

The file upcycled-science.do runs the simulation described in the post. The *estimates dataset* is means.dta and this is used for the analysis and to create the plots.

I am grateful to Ashley Holub for running Upcycled Science and dealing with my post.
